//  Compatibility shim: the actual cleanup logic now lives in `CleanupManager`, which also runs
//  after signing, downloads and on demand. These constants and calls are kept so the older
//  toggles (Signing Options → Delete After Installing, Storage → Clear Cache After Installing)
//  and every existing call site keep working unchanged.

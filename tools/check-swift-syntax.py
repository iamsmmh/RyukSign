"""Parse every Swift file in the repository with tree-sitter and report syntax errors.

There is no Swift toolchain on Linux and the real compile happens in CI on macOS
(`.github/workflows/build.yml`), so this is the local guard against a stray brace,
unbalanced parenthesis or truncated string before a build is spent on it.

    python3 tools/check-swift-syntax.py            # check the whole repo
    python3 tools/check-swift-syntax.py path …     # check files or directories

Only real `ERROR`/`MISSING` nodes count as failures. tree-sitter-swift sets `has_error`
on some zero-width `custom_operator` nodes (`as?` immediately followed by `??`) without
producing an error node at all — those are reported as notes and ignored.

Known grammar noise: about a dozen existing files (~12/296 on the tree this was written
against) trip the parser on valid Swift — `try await` on its own line, multi-part string
interpolation like `"\(a).\(b)"`. They are listed, so a *new* name in that list is the
signal; the baseline itself is not a real failure.

Exits non-zero when anything fails to parse.
